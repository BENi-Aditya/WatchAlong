PRD — Web-Based Synchronized Watch Platform (Proxy / Re-Streaming Model)
1. Problem (P)

Watching videos together remotely is still awkward.

Existing solutions rely on embeds and client-side playback. Ads appear unpredictably. Buffers differ. One pause ruins the moment. Sync drifts quietly until two people are laughing at different scenes. The illusion of “together” collapses.

Rave solves part of this—but locks users to specific platforms and devices. macOS users are excluded. Web users are second-class.

The real enemy is non-deterministic playback.

2. Agitation (A)

Humans are extremely sensitive to audiovisual mismatch. Research from ITU-R shows humans notice lip-sync errors above ~45 ms for audio-leading and ~125 ms for video-leading. Once desync crosses that threshold, immersion breaks immediately.

Ads worsen this:

Different ad inventory per user

Variable ad lengths

Mid-roll insertion without warning

Once one client diverges, resyncing becomes guesswork.

What should feel like watching together turns into:

“Wait, pause.”

“I’m at 3:42.”

“Reload.”

That friction kills the product.

3. Solution (S)

A server-authoritative proxy + re-streaming architecture.

No client controls playback directly.
No YouTube player on the client.
No ads.
No drift.

All users consume the same stream, controlled centrally, with deterministic timing.

4. Product Scope
4.1 Platform

Web application

Desktop-first, mobile-compatible

Chromium, Safari, Firefox supported

4.2 Supported Media (Phase 1)

YouTube links only

Ingested server-side

Transcoded or packet-forwarded without ads

5. Core Functional Requirements
5.1 Authentication & Accounts

Email + password

OAuth (Google) optional

Username + avatar

Presence status (online / in room)

5.2 Session Lifecycle
Create Session

Input: YouTube URL

Backend:

Validates URL

Extracts video ID

Starts ingest pipeline

Output:

Unique session ID

Short join code

Shareable link

Join Session

Via:

Join code

Direct link

Late joiners:

Instantly synced to current timestamp

5.3 Playback Model (Critical)
Authority

Server is the single source of truth

Clients are dumb renderers

Playback Actions

Play

Pause

Seek

Rate change (optional, phase 2)

All actions:

Triggered by host or any permitted user

Applied server-side

Broadcast as state updates

Sync Strategy

Server maintains:

Absolute playback time (monotonic clock)

Playback state

Clients:

Continuously reconcile local buffer vs server clock

Micro-correct using small skips, never hard jumps

Target drift: <50 ms

5.4 Chat

Real-time text chat

WebSocket-based

Timestamps relative to video time

Optional emoji reactions

5.5 Roles

Host

Full playback control

Participants

View + chat

Playback permissions configurable

6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Performance

Playback start latency: <2s after join

Control propagation: <150 ms

Chat latency: <100 ms

6.2 Scalability

2–10 users per room (Phase 1)

Horizontal scaling via stateless app servers

Media servers isolated

6.3 Reliability

Client reconnect auto-resync

Server crash recovery via session snapshot

7. Technical Architecture (High-Level)
Ingest

Server fetches YouTube stream

Removes ads implicitly by bypassing YouTube player

Extracts raw media stream

Processing

Optional transcoding to standardized bitrate

Segmenting into HLS/DASH

Distribution

Media server (e.g., NGINX + RTMP / WebRTC SFU)

CDN optional for scale

Control Plane

WebSockets for:

Playback commands

Chat

Presence

Data Plane

PostgreSQL: users, sessions

Redis: real-time state

Object storage: temporary segments

8. UI / UX Requirements
8.1 Visual Language

Frosted / liquid glass aesthetic

Inspired by Apple’s current design language:

Semi-transparent panels

Subtle Gaussian blur

Soft shadows

Minimal borders

No visual noise. No gradients for decoration. Everything earns its place.

8.2 Layout (Session View)
Left (Primary)

Video player

Rounded corners

Floating playback controls

Minimal chrome

Right (Secondary)

Chat panel

Collapsible

Frosted background

Message bubbles with light translucency

8.3 Typography

System fonts

Large, calm hierarchy

No aggressive weights

8.4 Motion

Micro-animations only

Ease-in-out

No bounce

Purpose: feedback, not flair

9. Security Considerations

HTTPS only

Signed session tokens

Rate limiting on join attempts

Stream URLs never exposed to clients

10. Out of Scope (Explicit)

DRM protection

Public rooms

Recording sessions

Native apps (for now)

11. Success Metrics

Time-to-sync for new joiner

Average playback drift

Session duration

Drop-off during first 5 minutes
